## What's CDN

CDN is a service dedicated to receice and retrieve logs. It replaces the old system that stored logs in the CDS database

A CDN instance is started with scope Project and Run using token.

CDN is linked to 2 types of storages:

* Buffer Unit: to store step log temporarily during the execution

* Storage Unit: to store complete step logs when it ends

## Use case
